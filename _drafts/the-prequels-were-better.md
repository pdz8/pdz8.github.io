title: "The prequels were better"
excerpt: >
    This is a departure from CS and tech, but hopefully still is "nerdy" enough to belong on this blog:
    The Star Wars prequels were better than the sequels. Get at me.

This shouldn't be news to you: *Start Wars Episode XII: The Force Awakens* is coming out Christmas day.
Like millions of fans around the world, I am delighted and can't wait to see it.
Anticipation of the new movie is causing a lot of people to start talking about *Star Wars* again.
Much to my annoyance however, this talk seems to inevitably lead to the repeated trashing of the *Star Wars* prequels (Episodes I-III) in comparison to the sequels (Episodes IV-VI).

I simply do not understand the hatred directed at the prequels.
Every single *Star Wars* fan seems utterly certain that none of Episodes I-III deserve to call themselves *Star Wars* films.
WHY??
I am not a professional film critic and have no authority to my claims, but I am going to try my best in this post to explain why I believe the prequels were vastly superior to the sequels.
Please challenge me and show me why I'm wrong. I want to know why I'm not seeing straight.

### Acting

The first thing always cited when thrashing the prequels was that their acting was atrocious.
This is when I start banging my head against the table.

Someone please explain to me how a cast including Ian McDiarmid, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Ewan McGregor gets beaten by Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher.
Who is Mark Hamill?
Somehow we let the performance of Hayden Christensen as Anakin undermine a star-studded cast to the point that they're beneath Mark Hamill.

Anakin Skywalker was the toughest role in the whole series.
Evolving from an innocent desert boy all the way to Darth Vader is something few actors can pull off.
Hayden Christensen was tasked with the most dynamic Walker White-like role and gets no credit for his efforts.
Luke, Han, and Leia have simple static characters (other than the cringy love story that serves absolutely no purpose).
They start off as good guys and they finish as good guys.
In the middle they might've gotten angry or had to let out a scream, but it wasn't [convincing][i-am-your-father].
One could argue that Darth Vader was dynamic character, but no one can seriously believe that breathing heavily and saying "Nooooo" is good acting.

### Plot


### Believability

I know *Star Wars* is a fantasy space film and cannot be compared to real-life on Earth.
However in order to seem real to viewers, it still has a responsibility to be consistent with the rules of its universe.
