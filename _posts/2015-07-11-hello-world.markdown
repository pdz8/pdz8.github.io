This is my obligatory introductory post. I am not a good writer. I am especially not a good writer when writing about my self. Bear with me as I get over this initial hump.

Hi, I'm Peter. I'm a recent computer science graduate that's starting a blog to continue talking about computer science outside of university. My interests lie primarily in theory of computation and systems. Their intersection is (in my opinion) cryptography and security, so that's particularly where my focus lies. Expect posts on the aforementioned subjects as well as general computer-related topics. Nice to meet you.

Yay, that's it!
