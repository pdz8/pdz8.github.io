I'm going to try giving this blog a bit more life.
It's sat on the sidelines the past couple of years while I've been busy with life (mostly work).
I should build more things for myself, and this is one of those things.

Posts will be different than they were years ago.
I'll discuss whatever I feel like on here, not restricted by topic or thoroughness.
This means the following topics can be expected:

* Rants
* Video games
* Politics
* Technology
* Rants
* Reviews
* Rambling complaints
* Commentary with negative spins

Hopefully posts will flow out.
